Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and then run the following code: <br />

### Method 1 (Try this first):

```

### Method 2 (Try this if the above method does not work):

Install Expo: <br />

```bash
npx expo-cli
```

Press 'a' or scan the QR code with the [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_CA&gl=US) on your mobile device after running the following code: <br />

```bash
npx expo start
```

Finally, If you want to compile our app, you can use 'run npm run deploy' to compile an Android app. Make sure you have an Expo account and that everything is set up. <br />
